In all interaction and commit messages be extremely concise.


## Session Continuity

At the end of every session or when the task is large, write a PROGRESS.md file in the project root summarizing: (1) what was completed, (2) what remains, (3) any decisions made, and (4) the next concrete step to take. This allows the next session to resume without re-exploration.

## Plans

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
